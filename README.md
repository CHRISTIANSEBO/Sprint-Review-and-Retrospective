# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

Sprint Review and Retrospective  

As the Scrum Master for the SNHU Travel project, I had the opportunity to oversee and participate in different roles throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC). This project required us to use the Scrum-Agile framework, and it gave me a lot of insight into how each role within the team contributed to the overall success of the project. In this review and retrospective, I will reflect on how we applied these roles, completed user stories, managed interruptions, communicated effectively, used organizational tools, and evaluated the Agile process itself. 

Applying Roles 

One of the key factors that contributed to the success of this project was the clear division of roles within our Scrum-Agile team. Each role was essential in its own way. As a Developer, I worked closely with the Product Owner to ensure that we were meeting the requirements outlined in the user stories. The Product Owner played a critical role in prioritizing tasks and clarifying the client’s needs, which kept us all aligned and focused (Podeswa, 2021). 

The Scrum Master’s role was equally important, ensuring that we stayed on track during each sprint and that obstacles were removed quickly. For instance, when we encountered issues with some technical aspects of the application, the Scrum Master organized quick stand-up meetings to discuss solutions, which helped us resolve problems before they slowed us down (Deemer et al., 2020). Overall, the collaboration among these roles ensured that we were always moving forward, even when challenges arose. 

Completing User Stories 

The Scrum-Agile approach made completing user stories more manageable and efficient. Instead of working through large chunks of development like in the Waterfall method, we broke the project into smaller, more achievable sprints. For example, one of the user stories was about integrating a search feature for travel destinations. Using Agile principles, we tackled this feature incrementally, first designing the interface, then connecting it to the backend, and finally testing it (Sommer, 2022). This approach allowed us to receive feedback early on, which helped us refine the feature and meet the client’s needs without wasting time or effort on unnecessary work. 

Handling Interruptions 

One of the most challenging parts of the project came when we had to change direction mid-development. There was a point where the client requested changes to the payment system, which wasn’t initially planned. Instead of derailing the entire project, the Scrum-Agile framework allowed us to handle the interruption smoothly. We re-prioritized the backlog and incorporated the changes into the upcoming sprint. The flexibility of Agile, particularly the ability to adapt to change, was crucial in this situation (Gustavsson & Rönnberg, 2020). It helped us stay on track while still addressing the client’s new requests. 

Communication 

Effective communication was vital throughout the development process. As part of our daily stand-ups, we shared updates, discussed any roadblocks, and clarified tasks. One specific instance that stands out is when we were debating how to implement the travel booking feature. I communicated with the team through our project management tool, laying out the pros and cons of two different technical approaches. This discussion helped us reach a consensus quickly, and because the communication was clear and to the point, we were able to move forward without confusion (Miller, 2021). 

Another example of strong communication was during the Sprint Review, where I provided the client with a clear summary of the work completed and the features ready for testing. This transparency helped build trust with the client and kept the team accountable for delivering high-quality work (Deemer et al., 2020). 

Organizational Tools 

Several organizational tools and Scrum-Agile principles helped our team stay successful. We used a Kanban board to organize tasks, which provided a visual representation of our progress. It was particularly helpful during the Sprint Planning sessions because it allowed us to break down user stories into smaller tasks and prioritize them easily (Royer & Royer, 2020). 

We also made great use of Scrum events like Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives. The Sprint Reviews helped us showcase our progress to stakeholders, while the Retrospectives gave us the chance to reflect on what worked and what didn’t. For instance, after one sprint where we struggled to meet our goals, we adjusted our approach to time management in the next sprint, which significantly improved our performance (Cohn, 2020). 

 

 

Evaluating the Agile Process 

Looking back at the SNHU Travel project, there were several pros and cons to the Scrum-Agile approach. One of the biggest advantages was the flexibility it offered. The iterative nature of Agile allowed us to make changes to the project as new requirements emerged, which wouldn’t have been possible with a traditional Waterfall model (Cohn, 2020). Additionally, the focus on continuous feedback meant that we were constantly improving the product, rather than waiting until the end to gather input. 

However, there were some drawbacks as well. For example, because Agile requires regular communication and meetings, it sometimes felt like we were spending more time talking about the work than actually doing it. This could be frustrating, especially when we were under tight deadlines. Additionally, the constant shifting of priorities could sometimes make it difficult to focus on long-term planning (Podeswa, 2021). 

That said, I believe that Agile was the best approach for this particular project. The client’s needs evolved over time, and Agile’s adaptability allowed us to respond to those changes quickly and effectively. If we had been using a more rigid framework, like Waterfall, we might have struggled to incorporate new features and keep the project on track. Overall, the Agile approach helped us deliver a product that met the client’s expectations while allowing for a collaborative, flexible, and efficient development process.
